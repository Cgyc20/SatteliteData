This code generates the synthetic data for Sentinel with a certain random seed. You can adjust the number of pixels, the lateral shift, how much we downscale by (to generate Lidar)

This code will also deform the image slightly and you can adjust the amount of gaussian noise in the corresponding lidar image.
